        <h1>Hello Digital Crafts!</h1>
        <p>First couple of weeks have flown by and I've learned alot about coding and myself.</p>
        <p>I embrace the challenge considering I have zero tech background unless you count navigating Facebook and sports betting websites.</p>
        <h2>Things I like about this bootcamp!</h2>
        <p>Acquiring new knowledge and concepts.</p>
        <p>The complexity makes me work harder which will hopefully become habit.</p>
        <h2>Things I like less about this bootcamp!</h2>
        <p>The commute.</p>
        <p>The time crunch.</p>
        <h3>Future goals!</h3>
        <p>Initially become a junior developer.</p>
        <p>Gradually move up the ranks.</p>
        <p>Eventually have my own business that I run from my recliner.</p>
